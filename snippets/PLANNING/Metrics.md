These metrics have been working well for me as i was studying a single neuron perceptron.   I just updated the engine to do a layer of neurons and soon it will support multiple layers.  However, I have not yet converted the reporting from a single neuron to support the layer of neurons.  My expectation is i will need to break this in to groups as some of these metrics apply to details within a neuron such as bias and weights, but others apply to the entire NN such as error, loss functions, and the confusion matrix.

I currently have 3 reports.
1) Iteration level (processing a single sample, predicting and adjusting based on the error)
2) Epoch level - summary of the epoch with these fields.poch Summary        │   Epoch │ Final    │ Final   │   Correct │   Wrong │ Accuracy   │ Mean      │ Mean       │ RMSE   │
│                      │         │ Weight   │ Bias    │           │         │            │ Abs Err   │ Sqr Err    │        

I wanted to seek your advice before proceeding.  Any advice is welcome but i'm specifically wondering
1) How should i divide these existing fields.
2) Am i missing any critical fields (list of info to add is infinte but am i missing anything critcal
3) Now analyzing multiple neurons, is there anything new to track.  
4) How to organize additions for example in the epoch summary it currently populates "final weights" in a single cell(with linefeeds, so that cell may use 5 lines per epoch (where all other fields fit on one).  now with multiple neurons i think i need a new plan.
5) it will be going to multiple layers soon.  i try to avoid building for future requirements but at the same time want to build in a way that can extend there, not go down the wrong road and realize need to reverse course

Thought about tracking metrics in neural networks for a couple of seconds
How to Divide Existing Fields:
Consider grouping metrics by their scope:

Network-level metrics: These are metrics that apply to the entire model, regardless of how many layers or neurons it has. Examples include:

Overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for classification tasks.
Aggregate loss functions (e.g., average cross-entropy loss or MSE across all output neurons).
High-level confusion matrix (for classification).
Layer-level metrics: For each layer, you might track:

A summary of average weight magnitudes, weight updates, or weight gradients.
Average activations of that layer’s neurons.
If it’s a hidden layer in a classification network, track how well that layer’s representation separates classes (this might be more for analysis than standard training logs).
Neuron-level metrics: For each individual neuron:

Final weights and bias values at the end of an epoch.
Individual error contributions (if meaningful).
Activation statistics (e.g., average activation during the epoch).
By splitting it this way, you can isolate neuron-level details (weights, bias) from global metrics (accuracy, F1) that apply to the entire output. This hierarchical approach (Network → Layers → Neurons) will help you scale as you add more layers and neurons.

Missing Critical Fields:
It depends on your training objectives, but some potentially valuable metrics might include:

Loss function breakdown: For neural networks, especially as you expand beyond a single neuron, a well-defined loss function (e.g., cross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression) is critical. Logging the average loss per epoch is often more critical than just absolute errors or confusion matrices.

Learning rate: If your training involves adaptive learning rates or scheduled changes, logging the learning rate per epoch can be invaluable for debugging and analysis.

Gradient norms: As your network grows, especially with multiple layers, gradients can explode or vanish. Tracking gradient norms per epoch could offer insight into training stability.

Regularization metrics: If you introduce L1/L2 regularization or dropout, tracking the related metrics (like average weight penalty or dropout rate) can be helpful.

Time per epoch: As the network grows, performance and resource usage become more relevant. Logging time taken per epoch can help identify scaling issues.

New Things to Track for Multiple Neurons:
When you have multiple neurons (and eventually multiple layers), you might consider:

Distribution of weights and biases: Instead of just the final weights, you might track statistics like min, max, mean, and standard deviation of weights in a layer.

Activation distributions: Observing how neuron activations are distributed can help you identify if neurons are saturating (e.g., always outputting near 0 or near 1).

Per-class metrics on each output neuron: If you have multiple output neurons for a multi-class classification, track precision, recall, and F1 per class (per neuron in the output layer).

Sparsity measures: For advanced scenarios, you might want to know how many neurons become effectively "dead" (e.g., ReLU neurons that don’t activate).

Organizing Additions for Reporting:
Right now, you have a single table row per epoch with metrics. If you’re adding multiple neurons and layers, it might be worth moving to a more structured representation that can still be reported in a tabular form but hierarchically. Some approaches:

Hierarchical output (e.g., JSON or nested dictionaries): Your epoch summary could produce a dict that looks like this:

json
Copy code
{
  "epoch": ...,
  "overall_metrics": {...},
  "layer_metrics": {
    "layer_1": {
      "neuron_1": {...},
      "neuron_2": {...},
      ...
    },
    "layer_2": {...},
    ...
  }
}
You can then convert these structures into tables as needed. For display, you might have one table for overall metrics and separate tables (or sections) for each layer.

Separate tables for different scopes: One table for overall metrics, one for each layer’s summary, and another one for neurons if needed. This avoids cramming all metrics into a single row with multiple lines.

Preparing for Multiple Layers Without Over-Engineering:
You don’t want to fully lock into a design that might not be needed, but you can at least choose data structures and naming conventions that scale naturally:

Use arrays or lists for layers and neurons, so adding another layer is just adding another entry rather than changing your whole reporting structure.

Keep the current metrics as a template. For each new complexity, introduce the minimum necessary detail and ensure it’s organized logically.

Avoid mixing concepts: keep weight/bias details close to the neuron definition, keep aggregate metrics at the top. This separation of concerns means if you add a layer, you add it into the hierarchical structure without needing to rewrite the reporting logic from scratch.

By making your code flexible (e.g., having functions that aggregate per-neuron metrics into layer-level metrics, and then combining layer-level metrics into network-level metrics), you’ll be prepared to scale up without rewriting your entire codebase.

In summary:

Break your metrics into at least three levels: network, layer, and neuron.
Consider adding key metrics like loss functions, gradient norms, or class-wise performance to enrich your analysis.
Move from a single-row report to a more hierarchical, structured output that you can still format into tables where needed.
Keep it flexible, focusing on a design that can naturally extend to multiple layers without forcing you to redo your fundamental reporting logic.
