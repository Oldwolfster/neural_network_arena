Neural Network Arena: The Battle of Learning Rates
Introduction
Greetings and welcome to the Neural Network Arena, where algorithms duke it out and only the fittest survive! I'm your boy, Simpleton, here to keep it simple with the Simpletron!
Today, we're diving into a battle of learning rates that'll make your neurons spin. Let's meet our contenders:z
In the left corner, weighing in with a hefty learning rate of 0.1, we have the notoriously reckless SimpletronFool! [Show cartoon of a simpletron tripping over its own wires]
And in the right corner, with a much smaller learning rate of 0.001, we have the calculating and wise genius, SimpletronEinstein! [Show cartoon of a simpletron with a wild Einstein hairstyle]
Will the fool's bold strategy pay off, or will Einstein's measured approach claim victory? Stick around to find out!
Personal Anecdote
First, a funny story. I've been working on the Simpletron for about three months now. I thought I had it all figured out - the math, the logic, everything was humming along with 80% accuracy. But then, when I went to make the first video, my accuracy plummeted to 50%! It was like watching my digital baby trip over its own feet. What went wrong? Turns out, understanding your learning rate is crucial—and that's exactly what we're going to explore today.
The Neural Network Arena
Before we throw them into the ring, let me show you around the Neural Network Arena so you know exactly where the action is happening:
Gladiators - The neural network models that duke it out.  So for example today, we're going to use the basic Simpletron with the only difference being the learning rate.  This will allow us to see exactly what's going on.
Training pits - The algorithm to create the training and test data. For today, we will have one input and one output.  A credit score from 1-100 and did they pay it back.
The Arena Engine - The heart of the battle, it basically runs the match.
1) Creates a single set of training data in the training pit
2) Feeds the identical data to all the gladiators competing.
3) Compiles the results, letting us see both summary and detail if we need it   This will give us  clear picture of who really has the edge.

Last thing before the begins, let's quickly recap the three simple steps of the Simpletron:
The key is having training data where you know both the question AND the answer. In this case, it's a credit score and a prediction if the loan will be paid. (In a real-world application, you would use more inputs, but to keep it focused on learning rate, we'll just use one.)

Step 1) Guess: That's this diagram at the bottom. It takes the credit score, multiplies it by the weight, and if that is greater than 0.5, it predicts the LOAN WILL BE PAID.  EASY
Step 2) Check the guess: As training data has both the input AND the output, we check if the guess is correct. If it is wrong, we measure how far off it is (that's called the loss).
STep 3) Adjust: If there is any loss, then we adjust the weight, but only by a small fraction of the loss. That fraction is known as the "Learning Rate".

You might be thinking, why adjust by just a fraction? Well, that's where the strategy comes in—and where the real battle begins.
Battle Commencement
So, lets get too it and see if SimpletronFool can redeem my clumsy mistake, or if SimpletronEinstein will prove that slow and steady wins the race!
