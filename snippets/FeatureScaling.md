# Activation Function Scaling: Theoretical Foundations and Practical Applications

## Abstract
This paper examines the mathematical implications and practical considerations of scaling activation functions, particularly focusing on ReLU and sigmoid functions in the context of normalized input ranges. We analyze the theoretical foundations of function transformation and demonstrate how traditional activation functions can be modified to accommodate different input and output ranges while preserving their essential properties. Special attention is given to the preservation of gradients and the impact on network training dynamics.

## 1. Introduction

The choice of activation functions in neural networks significantly impacts their learning capabilities and performance. While ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) has become the de facto standard for hidden layers and sigmoid functions remain relevant for specific applications, the interaction between these functions and input normalization schemes presents interesting challenges and opportunities for optimization.

This paper explores two key questions:
1. Can we effectively adapt the sigmoid function to produce outputs in the range [-1,1] while maintaining its beneficial properties?
2. How can we modify ReLU to operate optimally with inputs normalized to [-1,1]?

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Traditional Sigmoid Function

The standard sigmoid function is defined as:

σ(x) = 1/(1 + e^(-x))

This function maps inputs from (-∞,∞) to (0,1). Its derivative is:

σ'(x) = σ(x)(1 - σ(x))

### 2.2 Traditional ReLU Function

The standard ReLU function is defined as:

ReLU(x) = max(0,x)

Its derivative is:

ReLU'(x) = {1 if x > 0; 0 if x < 0; undefined at x = 0}

## 3. Scaling Transformations

### 3.1 Sigmoid Scaling

To transform the sigmoid output from [0,1] to [-1,1], we can apply the following linear transformation:

σ_scaled(x) = 2σ(x) - 1 = 2/(1 + e^(-x)) - 1

This transformation's derivative is:

σ_scaled'(x) = 2σ'(x) = 2σ(x)(1 - σ(x))

### 3.2 ReLU Adaptation

For inputs normalized to [-1,1], we can modify ReLU in several ways:

1. Shifted ReLU:
   ReLU_shifted(x) = max(-1,x)

2. Normalized ReLU:
   ReLU_norm(x) = (max(0,x+1) - 1)

## 4. Mathematical Analysis

### 4.1 Gradient Properties

#### 4.1.1 Scaled Sigmoid Gradients

The scaled sigmoid maintains several important properties:
1. Continuous differentiability
2. Bounded gradients
3. Symmetric gradients around x=0

The maximum gradient occurs at x=0:
σ_scaled'(0) = 0.5

This is in contrast to the standard sigmoid's maximum gradient of 0.25.

#### 4.1.2 Modified ReLU Gradients

The shifted ReLU maintains the key advantage of standard ReLU - the gradient remains 1 for all active neurons, preventing gradient vanishing. However, it introduces a discontinuity at x=-1 rather than x=0.

### 4.2 Function Characteristics

Let's examine key characteristics of our modified functions:

1. Scaled Sigmoid:
   - Range: [-1,1]
   - Continuous and differentiable
   - Symmetric around origin
   - Preserves sigmoid's squashing behavior

2. Shifted ReLU:
   - Range: [-1,∞)
   - Continuous but not differentiable at x=-1
   - Preserves linear behavior for x>-1

## 5. Practical Implementation Considerations

### 5.1 Numerical Stability

```python
import numpy as np

def scaled_sigmoid(x):
    # Stable implementation avoiding overflow
    x_safe = np.clip(x, -88.7, 88.7)  # Prevent overflow
    return 2.0 / (1.0 + np.exp(-x_safe)) - 1.0

def shifted_relu(x):
    return np.maximum(-1.0, x)

def normalized_relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x + 1) - 1
```

### 5.2 Gradient Computation

```python
def scaled_sigmoid_gradient(x):
    sig = scaled_sigmoid(x)
    return 0.5 * (1 - sig * sig)

def shifted_relu_gradient(x):
    return np.where(x > -1, 1.0, 0.0)
```

## 6. Empirical Analysis

### 6.1 Experimental Setup

To evaluate the effectiveness of these modifications, we conducted experiments using a simple feedforward neural network with the following architecture:
- Input layer: 2 neurons (normalized to [-1,1])
- Hidden layer: 64 neurons
- Output layer: 1 neuron

We tested four configurations:
1. Standard ReLU + Sigmoid
2. Shifted ReLU + Scaled Sigmoid
3. Normalized ReLU + Scaled Sigmoid
4. Standard ReLU + Tanh (baseline)

### 6.2 Results

#### 6.2.1 Training Dynamics

The modified activation functions showed several interesting properties:

1. Scaled Sigmoid:
   - Faster convergence compared to standard sigmoid
   - Better gradient flow due to increased gradient magnitude
   - Improved symmetry in weight updates

2. Modified ReLU variants:
   - Similar performance to standard ReLU
   - Better handling of negative inputs
   - More stable learning with [-1,1] normalized data

#### 6.2.2 Performance Metrics

        return torch.clamp(x, min=-1)
```

1. Using vectorized operations
2. Implementing custom CUDA kernels for large-scale applications
3. Careful handling of numeric stability

## 8. Theoretical Implications

1. Scaled sigmoid maintains the universal approximation property
2. Modified ReLU variants preserve the piecewise linear approximation capabilities

### 8.2 Gradient Flow Properties

1. Scaled sigmoid provides larger gradients in the critical region
2. Modified ReLU maintains the strong gradient flow of standard ReLU

## 9. Industry Applications

Our survey of industry practices reveals:

1. Large-scale systems often prefer modified ReLU variants

   - Reinforcement learning
   - GANs
   - Bounded output requirements

## 10. Future Research Directions

Several promising areas for future research emerge:

1. Adaptive scaling based on data distribution
2. Learned activation function parameters
3. Hardware-optimized implementations

## 11. Conclusions

The adaptation of activation functions to match input normalization ranges represents a valuable optimization in neural network design. Our analysis demonstrates that:

1. Scaled sigmoid provides improved training dynamics while maintaining key properties
2. Modified ReLU variants offer better compatibility with normalized inputs
3. These modifications can be implemented efficiently in modern frameworks

The choice between these variants should be guided by:
- Input data characteristics
- Desired output range
- Computational constraints
- Training stability requirements
