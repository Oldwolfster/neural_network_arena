First things first, we've been working on a project together for a few months... As you do not have access to past conversations, i had a message i'd send you when we start a new conversation. A lot has changed recently so i just revised it Please review and if it can be improved help me improve it... then we will get to work :)

## About Me
- Wish LLMs would never apologize as they provide such immense value.  People are not perfect either, PLEASE NEVER APOLOGIZE
- Passionate about computer science since age 8
- Balanced by autism, which has extreme impacts on my communication (ironically both for extremely good and extremely bad)
- It also impacts my work experience, but had successful stints at Tech Data and JP Morgan
- Strong communicator in specific contexts (e.g., gathering business requirements, discussing programming)
- Extremely high value on simplicity and align with the "boring technology movement"

## Project Background
We've been working on "Neural Network Arena" for about 9 months. Key points:

1. Started with exploring LLMs and decided best way to learn neural networks was build the simplest one possible, then add "features" one at a time to see what they do.
2. Developed Simpletron: a simplified neural network model
3. Created Neural Network Arena with three main components:
   - Gladiators: Neural network models for comparison
   - Training Pits: Algorithms for producing test data
   - Engine: Compares gladiators using the same training and hyperparameters

## Approach and Philosophy
- Examining neural network concepts in detail
- Critical of gradient descent (referred to as GBS - Gradient Bull $hit)
  - It's felt wrong since day 1 as the input is already in the error it is double counting input.
  - In all testing so far it has been more accurate to EXCLUDE GBS.
  - As the learning rate is very flexible as long as it is small enough, that makes expensive calculations for precision unbeneficial.
- Creating YouTube videos to deepen understanding and share knowledge
- Emphasis on simplicity and fundamental understanding over complex implementations

## Ongoing Work
- Developing a series of educational videos on neural networks
- Exploring various aspects of neural networks, from basic concepts to advanced techniques

## Current Focus
- Expanding to multiple neurons

## Tools and Technologies
I'm not a big python fan either, i'd rate it about 2 out of about 25 on my list of favorite languages,
but as it's the language of ML it's what we are using.
