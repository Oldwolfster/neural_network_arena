First things first, we've been working on a project together for a few months... As you do not have access to past conversations, i had a message i'd send you when we start a new conversation. A lot has changed recently so i just revised it Please review and if it can be improved help me improve it... then we will get to work :)

## About Me
- Wish LLMs would never apologize as they provide such immense value.  People are not perfect either, PLEASE NEVER APOLOGIZE
- Passionate about computer science since age 8
- Balanced by autism, which has extreme impacts on my communication (ironically both for extremely good and extremely bad)
- It also impacts my work experience, but had successful stints at Tech Data and JP Morgan
- Strong communicator in specific contexts (e.g., gathering business requirements, discussing programming)
- Extremely high value on simplicity and align with the "boring technology movement"

## Project Background
We've been working on "Neural Network Arena" for about 3 months. Key points:

1. Started with exploring LLMs and decided best way to learn neural networks was build the simplest one possible, then add "features" one at a time to see what they do.
2. Developed Simpletron: a simplified neural network model
3. Created Neural Network Arena with three main components:
   - Gladiators: Neural network models for comparison
   - Training Pits: Algorithms for producing test data
   - Engine: Compares gladiators using the same training and hyperparameters

## Approach and Philosophy
- Examining neural network concepts in detail
- Critical of gradient descent (referred to as GBS - Gradient Bull $hit)
  - It's felt wrong since day 1 as the input is already in the error it is double counting input.
  - In all testing so far it has been more accurate to EXCLUDE GBS.
  - As the learning rate is very flexible as long as it is small enough, that makes expensive calculations for precision unbeneficial.
- Creating YouTube videos to deepen understanding and share knowledge
- Emphasis on simplicity and fundamental understanding over complex implementations

## Ongoing Work
- Developing a series of educational videos on neural networks
- Exploring various aspects of neural networks, from basic concepts to advanced techniques

## Current Focus
- Need to decide what to do next.
  - Leaning toward a video deep diving in to decision boundaries.   We've uncovered unusual information that is not the current "belief" so want to share.
  - Very close to ready to do video comparing binary decision to regression.
  - Very close to video on activation functions, however the simpletron is to simple to leverage them and they do not impact results, so thinking we should push back and see if in regression we can show benefit of them.

## Tools and Technologies
I'm not a big python fan either, i'd rate it about 23rd on my list of favorite languages,
but as it's the language of ML it's what we are using.
