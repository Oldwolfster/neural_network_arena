# Why Gradient Descent is bs.

1) it can be arbitray, credit score could be structured good is high or good is low.
2) when it's multiplied by learning rate that washes out the complex logic.
3) all that really counts is that it moves in the right direction
4) the inputs value doesn't necessarily represent it's contribution to the error
