🎬 The Family Movie Metaphor
Let’s break it down in your words — and fill in the labels as we go:

🎥 Forward Prop = Decision Phase
Children (inputs) toss out ideas:
"Let’s watch a Marvel movie!"
"How about something animated?"

Parents (middle layer) weigh the suggestions:
"Hmm... maybe Spider-Verse? Or Elemental?"
They combine the kids’ preferences with their own biases (weights), then...

Grandparents (output layer) make the final call:
"Alright, we’ll go with Spider-Verse."

The signal has moved forward through the family tree — each generation processing what they received.

🔁 Backward Prop = Blame Phase
They watch the movie... and it’s a disaster. 😩
("Too loud!" "Didn’t understand it!"_)

Grandparents say:
"Why did we agree to this? The parents convinced us!"

Parents go:
"We were just trying to make the kids happy!"

And the blame flows backward — each layer passing responsibility upstream.

🧠 What This Solves
✅ Preserves parent–child direction in forward flow (still accurate structurally)

✅ Justifies blame flowing in reverse during backprop (natural and intuitive)

✅ Makes adjustments feel like “family therapy” after a bad choice 😄

✅ Reinforces the core idea:
"Outputs are built by children → parents → grandparents, but errors are explained by grandparents → parents → children."

💡 Tooltip/Wiki Version:
Forward Pass
“The family decides which movie to watch — kids suggest, parents refine, grandparents decide.”

Backward Pass
“The movie sucked. Grandparents blame parents. Parents blame kids. Everyone adjusts their preferences next time.”
