    Generates regression training data with a linear relationship between inputs and salary.
    This makes it solvable by a single neuron perceptron with two inputs.
    NOTE:   The Optimum bias and weights are the base salary and coefficients.
            When done training the parameters of the model should match what was set here!!!

    To make the salary calculation solvable by a single neuron perceptron with two inputs,
    we need to ensure that the relationship between the inputs and the salary is linear.
