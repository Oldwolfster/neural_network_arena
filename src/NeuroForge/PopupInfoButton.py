            Welcome to NeuroForge—our visuals and terminology aren’t the “textbook” defaults, so here’s what to expect:
        
            Neurons as Machines
            Each neuron is a little machine that contains its own weights, bias, activations; most importantly, inputs and output.
        
            Arrows = Outputs
            The arrows between neurons show the output traveling from one neuron to the input on the next, not the “weight” itself.
        
            Language Should Clarify — Not Confuse
            We’ve found that the traditional terminology often obscures more than it reveals. For example:
        
            “Linear Activation Function” sounds like it does something, but it really just means: no activation at all.
        
            The word “Gradient” is dangerous.  
            It shows up everywhere, but its meaning shifts constantly.  (Some story about a 17D mountain LOL)
            Most of the time, it just means:  
            “How much should this weight change?”  
            We skip the jargon and say exactly that.
            
            For regression tasks, "Accuracy" is defined as 1 - (MAE / mean target), 
            providing an intuitive % that reflects prediction closeness.

            
            We aim for:
            * Simple but precise language
            * Visuals that match intuition
            * Transparency over tradition
        
            If you're used to academic ML tools, this might feel a little unorthodox — and that's the point.
        
            Thanks for exploring NeuroForge. We hope it helps make the ideas click! :)
