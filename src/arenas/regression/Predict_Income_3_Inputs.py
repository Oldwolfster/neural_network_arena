    Generates regression training data with a linear relationship between inputs and salary.
    This makes it solvable by a single neuron perceptron without adding extra inputs.
    NOTE:   Optimum bias should be the base salary!
            Optimum weights should be the coefficients.

    To make the salary calculation solvable by a single neuron perceptron with three inputs, we ensure that the relationship between the inputs and the salary is linear.

    Salary = Base Salary + (Coefficient1 × Years of Experience)
             + (Coefficient2 × College) + (Coefficient3 × Certifications) + Noise

    Loss Function: Mean squared error (since it's a regression task).
