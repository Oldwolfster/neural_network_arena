"""
    🚀 Welcome to Programming (You’re Gonna Crush This)
    👉 You only need to learn about 5 basic building blocks.
    That’s it.
    And they’re simple — way simpler than anything you learned in chemistry.
    Think of it like a periodic table... with just 5 elements.

    💪 With those few elements, you can literally build anything.
    Combine them to solve small problems — like a spark plug or a distributor cap.
    Then group those into systems that solve bigger problems...
    Like: “Drive my ass to McDonald's.” 😈

    👑 Just like atoms make molecules
    → that make systems
    → that make even bigger systems (repeat ×10)
    → that make galaxies
    → that make uni+verses...

    Today you build a spark plug.
    Tomorrow? You rule the galaxy.🥂
