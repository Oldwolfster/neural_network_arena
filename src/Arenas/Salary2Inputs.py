    Concrete class that generates regression training data.
    It models years of experience (0 to 40) and uses it to generate a continuous target value
    representing the salary in thousands of dollars.

    This version introduces a non-zero intercept to ensure the data doesn't pass through
    the origin. The salary is determined by adjusting the slope and adding random noise for variance.
