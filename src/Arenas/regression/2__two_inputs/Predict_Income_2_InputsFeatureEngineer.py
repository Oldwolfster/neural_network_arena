    Generates regression training data with a linear relationship between inputs and salary.
    To enable the perceptron to model this non-linear relationship, we'll engineer
    a new feature that represents the interaction between years_experience and college.

    Interaction Term:
        Interaction Term = Years of Experience × CollegeInteraction Term=Years of Experience × College
        Expanded Salary Equation:
            The original salary calculation is: Salary = (30 + 4y) X (C +.4)
            When expanded (FOIL) it becomes Salary = (30C + 15) + (4y X C + 2y)
            This shows that the salary depends on:
                Years of Experience (𝑌)
                College (𝐶C)
                Interaction Term (Y×C)
