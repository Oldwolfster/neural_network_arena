    🔮 Example Problem: Predicting Customer Churn Risk Score
    Imagine you’re building a system for a subscription-based SaaS company that wants to predict the risk of a customer churning — not as a yes/no (classification), but as a continuous score from 0 to 1. This score represents the likelihood that a customer will cancel their subscription in the next 30 days.

    🧠 Architecture
    Layer	Purpose
    🔢 Input	10–20 features: usage metrics, login frequency, support tickets, invoice payment timing, etc.
    🔁 Hidden #1	ReLU — learns low-level features: e.g., "low login + late invoice"
    🔁 Hidden #2	ReLU — combines patterns: "usage downtrend + payment friction"
    🔁 Hidden #3	ReLU — refines latent risk patterns
    🔚 Output	Sigmoid — outputs a smooth score between 0–1
