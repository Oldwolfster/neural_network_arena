    Brutally difficult arena that requires memory.

    There are two regimes (A and B) that *look identical in input* â€” the only way to
    predict the correct target is to know what regime you're in, which is toggled by
    a hidden input *several samples ago*.

    Without state, no network can track the flip â€” FFNNs will average the regimes and fail.

    Perfect for proving the limit of stateless feedforward networks.
