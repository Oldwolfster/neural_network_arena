    Combines several learnable regimes — but:
    - The regime selector is *not* exposed as an input.
    - Some inputs have misleading correlations that flip per regime.
    - Signal strength varies drastically (some regimes weak, some strong).
    - There's one faint, reliable signal buried in the noise.

    This tests whether a network can disentangle complex, conflicting signal sources
    when no single rule applies globally — perfect for breaking naive generalization.
