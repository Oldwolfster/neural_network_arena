Rationale for Adding Multiple Neurons in a Single Layer
When you have a single neuron, it’s effectively creating a single linear boundary or a single perspective on the data. It combines the inputs in one specific way, which might limit its ability to capture complex patterns. Adding multiple neurons allows you to create multiple linear boundaries or perspectives, which can be combined to form a more nuanced, flexible decision boundary. Here’s how that could play out in your example.

Example: Predicting Loan Repayment Probability with Multiple Neurons in a Single Layer
Goal
Predict the probability that an applicant will repay their loan, given four features:

Credit Score
Income
Time on Job
Marital Status
Network Setup
Let’s say we add three neurons in a single layer, each designed to capture different aspects or combinations of the input features.

Input Layer:
Four features (credit score, income, time on job, marital status) are provided as inputs to the network.

Single Hidden Layer with Three Neurons:

Neuron 1: Learns a combination of the inputs that might emphasize, say, credit score and income as the primary indicators for loan repayment probability.
Neuron 2: Focuses on time on job and income, capturing applicants with long employment histories and stable incomes.
Neuron 3: Might learn a combination that gives more weight to marital status along with credit score.
Each neuron independently creates a different perspective or “view” on the input data based on the feature weights it learns during training.

Output:
After calculating a weighted sum for each neuron’s output, you could apply a sigmoid activation function to each neuron to produce an individual probability score from each neuron. You then take these outputs and aggregate them in one of two ways:
Average the Outputs: Compute the mean of the three probability outputs from each neuron to create a single predicted probability for loan repayment.
Trainable Output Weighting: Use a second layer with one neuron that combines the three outputs, effectively weighting each neuron's output differently to make the final prediction. This can add flexibility, though it adds a minor layer of complexity.
Why This Approach Works
Captures Independent Patterns:
Each neuron is free to learn different relationships among the inputs, effectively creating independent classifiers for repayment probability. For example, one neuron might specialize in predicting based on strong credit histories, while another might focus on income stability.

Enables a Richer Decision Boundary:
By combining the outputs of three neurons, the model can create a more nuanced, piecewise linear boundary, allowing it to separate the "will repay" and "won't repay" classes more effectively than a single linear function.

Increases Robustness to Noise and Variability:
Since each neuron has its own perspective, the combined output is less sensitive to variations in a single feature. This setup can improve the model’s generalization on complex data, reducing the risk of overfitting to one particular signal.

Visualizing This Setup
Imagine each neuron as defining a “line of decision” in a multi-dimensional space (defined by the four inputs). With three neurons, the model essentially creates a combination of three such lines, which together approximate a more complex decision surface than a single line from a single neuron.

Potential Results and Limitations
Improved Predictive Power:
By capturing different perspectives, this setup can better predict borderline cases. For example, applicants with low income but high credit scores might get a different treatment compared to applicants with long job tenure but moderate credit.

Still Limited by Linearity:
Since this is a single-layer network, each neuron only performs a linear combination of inputs. If the loan repayment prediction problem requires capturing non-linear relationships among features, multiple layers or non-linear transformations (e.g., adding polynomial features) might still be necessary.

Interpretability:
Adding multiple neurons can add some interpretability challenges, as it becomes harder to attribute the prediction to a single clear pattern. However, you can still interpret each neuron’s learned weights to understand its “focus” on the data.

Summary
Adding two more neurons in a single layer allows the model to create multiple perspectives on the input features, enhancing its ability to capture more complex, nuanced relationships in the data. This structure is more powerful than a single neuron but still simple and interpretable, making it a valuable intermediate step before moving to multi-layer architectures.
