# Introduction and Context Setting

**Standard Greeting:**
Greetings and welcome to another episode of Neural Network Arena, where algorithms duke it out and only the fittest survive!
Today, we're ...
So sit back and ....

# Hook the Audience  

> <<Visual of robot appreciating jazz rather than evreything being black or white..>>

Ever wondered what happens when our Simpletron gets tired of just 'yes' or 'no' answers?
Today, we're upgrading our binary buddy to handle the infinite possibilities of the real world!
It's like teaching a robot to appreciate jazz—not everything is black and white, 
sometimes it's all about that smooth continuum!

# Contender Introductions

> <<Visual of Arena>>

In today's showdown, we're bringing back our champions from 'Bias: Is It for the Birds?' 
because, spoiler alert, bias is about to take center stage.

> <<Visual of Hayabusa>>

In the left corner we have Hayabusa, just like the legendary bike with all the bells and whistles 
this model will include a bias mechanism.

> <<Visual of Blackbird>>

In the right corner, meet Blackbird—a sleek and powerful model, but without the bias boost. 

Will Hayabusa's extra 'bias' give it the horsepower to outpace Blackbird, or will 
Blackbird prove that sometimes less is more? Let's rev those engines and find out!

# NNA Tour

"I'm your host and guide through the Neural Network Arena, where epic battles between algorithms unfold. 
Let's take a quick tour!"

> <<Visual of 7 line NN>>>

We begin with Simpletron—the simplest neural network around. 
You might wonder, 'Why start simple?' Well, simplicity lets us focus on the fundamentals
- See the mechanics in action without getting lost in complexity.
- Test different neural network techniques efficiently.
- "Isolate and understand the impact of each technique clearly.

And trust me, with Simpletron, you won't need a pit crew—just a passion for learning!

> <<Diagram of NNA architecture>>

Our Neural Network Arena consists of three main components:

1. **The Gladiators:**  These are our neural networks—the contenders. Each Gladiator embodies a 
specific set of logic and capabilities. Simpletron is our original champion!"

2. **The Arenas:**  This is where we generate our training data—the battlegrounds where our 
Gladiators prove their mettle."

3. **The Engine:** The heart of the operation. It feeds data from the Arena to the Gladiators,
collects their predictions,
and provides us with valuable insights.
It's important to note.  It sends identical data to each Gladiator.
No favoritism here—the Engine ensures a level playing field for all our contenders

# Refactor

> <<VISUAL code being "pampered" at a spa—perhaps code lines wearing a face mask and cucumber slices.>>

Before we dive into the exciting world of regression, I've got some updates. 
While tinkering with regression, we discovered a couple of things:
1) Regression and Binary Decision  Don't Play Well Together:
    "They clash like cats and dogs—or should I say, zeros and ones!"
2) Our Old Simpletron Template Was Violating the 'DRY' Principle:
   That's 'Don't Repeat Yourself' for those new to coding lingo. 
3) Repetition in code is like telling the same joke twice—it loses its charm!

> <<Visual of Goals Listed>>

So we decided to do a refactor, think of it as a software day at the  spa.

**Goal 1: Move Repetitive Code to the Engine:**
- By centralizing the common code, it's easier to read and create new Gladiators. 
- Most importantly, it ensures consistency—every model plays by the same rules.

**Goal 2: Store Data Properly:**  We shifted from on-the-fly reporting to structured data storage. 
- This makes it easier to analyze results, extract insights, and down the road could lead to some really cool stuff (like watching them compete in real time)

**Goal 3: Harmonize Regression and Binary Decision Models:** We wanted these two to live together in harmony
- but the way things stood, it was like Angus of AC/DC jamming out with a barbershop quartet..
- Both amazing by themselves...  but not good together!

> <<Visual of comparision between old and new template>>

So this improved the template in two places.
- looping through epochs and itertions.
- Recording Results

# Battle Focus: Regression

So let's get to regression.  Regression predicts things like the exact amount of coffee you'll 
need to survive a Monday morning—an infinite spectrum!

> <<Visual - left half pizza yes/no - right half on scale of 1 to 100>>

Or think of it in terms of pizza.
- Binary Decision is "Do you want Pizza?  Yes or No"
- Regression is on a scale of 1-100, how much do you want Pizza?
Spoiler Alert:  If your asking a programmer, it's ALWAYS 100.  Just slide it under the door and run!!!

> << While using a visual illustrating >>

As you can see, binary classification sorts data into distinct groups—like sorting apples and oranges. 
Regression, however, fits a line through data points to predict continuous 
outcomes—like estimating the weight of fruit based on its size.

In binary classification, we use accuracy—did we correctly predict 'yes' or 'no'? 
Simple and straightforward."

In regression, we care about 'how close' we are to the actual value. 
This is where loss functions like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) come into play.
(and no, 'Mean' here isn't when your little sister eats the last donut, even though shes not hungry)

In regression, predicting the exact value is like finding a needle in a haystack. 
If a house is worth 123,456 dollars and 78 cents.  then 123,456 dollars and 79 cents is 
a pretty darned good prediction.  But technically it's wrong.
That's why experts prefer error metrics over accuracy for regression.
But hey, rules are made to be bent a little, right? So I introduced an 'accuracy' measure for regression
—if we're within 0.5% of the target, we call it a win!
I'm a big beliver in the more clues the better.
And not for nothing when i ran it by the normally very polite chatGPT, it said i was mixing horseshoes handgrenades and nuclear bombs.
Those NN Aficionados don't need to read it if they dont want..

Now, let's see how we adapt our training data for regression.
Previously, we generated a credit score between 1 and 100 and predicted whether 
a loan would be repaid—yes or no.

To ease into regression, we'll keep the credit scores but instead predict the probability of loan repayment—
one of the infinite values between 0 and 1

In binary decision, we're asking 'Will the loan be repaid?'. In regression, we're asking 
'What's the likelihood the loan will be repaid?'. 
It's a subtle but significant shift!

With the theory covered, it's time for action! 
and feel free to code along!  It's posted on github and the link is in the comments!

# Code Forge
Here's our game plan:
1) Look at the new even simpler Simpletron.  I'll show it side by side with the old one so you can see what's no longer required
2) Modify that new template from BD to Regression (that will be the Blackbird).
3) Add a bias component—that will be the Hayabusa.

And with that, we are ready to unleash our Gladiators into three different Arena's and the Rumble will commence.
And best yet, you get to play along at home.  When you see each Arena i'll ask you pick the winner!  So don't fall asleep now!
