# Neural Network Weight Pattern Dictionary

## Pattern Categories

### 1. Feature Detector Patterns

#### Balanced Specialist
- **Neuron Color**: Green (Low Error)
- **Input Pattern**:
  - 2-3 strong positive weights (thick red)
  - 2-3 strong negative weights (thick blue)
  - Many near-zero weights (thin neutral)
- **Output Pattern**:
  - Selective strong connections to next layer
  - Most outgoing weights near zero
- **Interpretation**: Well-trained feature detector that has learned to respond to specific input combinations
- **Health Indicator**: Very healthy, typical of successful training

#### Distributed Generalist
- **Neuron Color**: Light Green to Neutral
- **Input Pattern**:
  - Many moderate-strength weights
  - Even distribution of positive/negative
  - Few/no near-zero weights
- **Output Pattern**:
  - Multiple moderate connections to next layer
  - Broadly distributed influence
- **Interpretation**: Neuron participating in distributed representations
- **Health Indicator**: Healthy, common in middle layers

### 2. Warning Patterns

#### Error Amplifier
- **Neuron Color**: Bright Red
- **Input Pattern**:
  - Many strong weights of same sign
  - Few/no counterbalancing weights
- **Output Pattern**:
  - Strong connections to many neurons in next layer
  - Primarily same-signed weights
- **Interpretation**: Neuron amplifying and propagating errors
- **Health Indicator**: Problematic, may need learning rate adjustment

#### Oscillating Neuron
- **Neuron Color**: Fluctuating Red/Green
- **Input Pattern**:
  - Weights showing regular sign flips
  - High magnitude variance over time
- **Output Pattern**:
  - Similar oscillation in outgoing weights
  - Unstable influence on next layer
- **Interpretation**: Caught in local minimum or learning rate too high
- **Health Indicator**: Needs attention, consider momentum adjustment

### 3. Developmental Patterns

#### Early Specialization
- **Neuron Color**: Green → Greener
- **Input Pattern**:
  - Initially random weights
  - Rapidly developing strong preferences
  - Clear pruning of irrelevant connections
- **Output Pattern**:
  - Increasingly focused influence
  - Stabilizing connection pattern
- **Interpretation**: Healthy feature detector formation
- **Health Indicator**: Positive early training indicator

#### Gradual Refinement
- **Neuron Color**: Neutral → Light Green
- **Input Pattern**:
  - Slow, steady weight changes
  - Gradual development of preference
- **Output Pattern**:
  - Slowly stabilizing connections
  - Maintained broad influence
- **Interpretation**: Normal deep layer development
- **Health Indicator**: Healthy for deeper layers

### 4. Problematic Patterns

#### Dead Neuron
- **Neuron Color**: Neutral to Gray
- **Input Pattern**:
  - Very small weights
  - Minimal changes over time
- **Output Pattern**:
  - Near-zero outgoing weights
  - No significant influence
- **Interpretation**: Neuron not participating in learning
- **Health Indicator**: Poor, consider architecture changes

#### Dominator Neuron
- **Neuron Color**: Usually Green
- **Input Pattern**:
  - Very strong incoming weights
  - Possibly saturated
- **Output Pattern**:
  - Extremely strong outgoing weights
  - Dominates next layer's behavior
- **Interpretation**: Single neuron with too much influence
- **Health Indicator**: Problematic, suggests poor weight initialization

## Using This Dictionary

### For Training Monitoring
1. Regularly sample neurons across layers
2. Compare observed patterns to dictionary
3. Track pattern evolution over training
4. Use as early warning system for training issues

### For Architecture Debugging
1. Identify problematic patterns
2. Cross-reference with layer position
3. Use patterns to guide architecture adjustments
4. Monitor pattern changes after modifications

### For Hyperparameter Tuning
1. Note pattern responses to parameter changes
2. Use pattern transitions as tuning feedback
3. Optimize for healthy pattern development
4. Avoid parameter ranges that encourage problematic patterns

## Pattern Evolution Guidelines

### Healthy Evolution
- Random → Early Specialization → Balanced Specialist
- Random → Gradual Refinement → Distributed Generalist
- Occasional oscillation → stabilization

### Warning Signs
